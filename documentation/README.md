# API - powered by eVitalRx

## Introduction

**eVitalRx** provides the **API product** to empower the **Patient and Doctor Apps** where one can search Medicines or OTCs and get an updated price, stock, and alternatives from the inventory of linked Pharmacy in real-time. Also, one can **Place the Order** or **Push the Prescription** to the pharmacy and various other smart and integrated features.

## Scope of API

The scope of integration is to maintain syncing of the data between two platforms. The integration would act as a bridge to reduce the complexity and optimize the business processes.

* **Available Inventory** would be reflected in the Apps with all the updated details of the medicines and OTCs.
* **Place the order** or **Push the Prescription** to the Pharmacy from the Patient or Doctor App and it will reflect the same in the eVitalRx.
* **Generated orders** would be reflected on all the platforms with customers and payment status.&#x20;
* **Order status** would be updated to the respected app too.
* **Patients added** from Apps to eVitalRx would be reflected in eVitalRx with the past order history.
