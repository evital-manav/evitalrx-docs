# Reports

The **Master Bundle API** provides two types of reports: the **Margin Report**, which details product margins, pricing, and related financial information, and the **Stock Summary Report**, which offers a comprehensive overview of stock levels, details, and product locations. Users can request these reports in either compressed or non-compressed formats, allowing for flexibility in data presentation and usage.

**Here is the Postman Collection of APIs**
