# Introduction

The healthcare industry is changing how it serves patients, and a fulfillment API is a prime example. By merging GPS and medication data, this API facilitates medication delivery by directing orders to nearby pharmacies with the required medication in stock. The patient can then choose either pickup or delivery, streamlining the order fulfillment process.
